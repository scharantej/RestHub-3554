## Flask Application Design for Restaurant Reservation

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: The main landing page of the website, where users can make a reservation. It includes a form with fields for the user's name, email, phone number, date, time, and number of people.

- **confirmation.html**: This page is displayed to the user after they submit the reservation form. It provides a summary of the reservation details and a confirmation message.

- **error.html**: This page is displayed if there is an error in the reservation process, such as incorrect input or unavailability of the requested time slot.

### Routes

- **home**: The root route that displays the index.html page.

- **reserve**: This route handles the reservation form submission. It validates the input, checks for availability, and if everything is valid, stores the reservation details in a database or other persistence mechanism. It then redirects the user to the confirmation page.

- **error**: This route handles errors that occur during the reservation process. It displays the error.html page with an appropriate error message.

- **about**: This route can be used to display a page with additional information about the restaurant, such as its location, contact information, and hours of operation.

- **menu**: This route can be used to display a page with the restaurant's menu.

### Implementation Details

- The application can use the Flask-Bootstrap extension to integrate Bootstrap for the frontend.
- The application should use a database or other persistence mechanism to store the reservation details.
- The application should implement validation checks for the form inputs to ensure that the information provided is correct.
- The application can use email or SMS to send confirmation messages to users.
